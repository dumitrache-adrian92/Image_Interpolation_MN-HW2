Boring Numerical Methods assignment that's incomprehensible without reading 20 pages of docs, it's just a bunch of Octave functions that receive an image matrix and perform scaling, resizing and rotation using either proximal or bicubic methods. There's not much else to it and there was no creativity involved as what you were supposed to do was given as is.
